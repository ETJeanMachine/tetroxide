tetroxide

Great progress and good checkpoint document.

Seems like a lot of good progress has been made on the project.  Good
division into a general `tetris` crate separate from a `tetroxide` UI
crate.

Looks like some subtle code is needed to accurately replicate Tetris;
the `Bag` for ensuring a consistent sequence of random tetronimos; the
various rules for rotation.

`crossterm` and `tui` seem like good choices.  Final writeup might
include a brief analysis of how well they worked for the project.

Look over the rubric for the final project writeup
(https://www.cs.rit.edu/~mtf/teaching/20225/psr/project.html#final_project)
and think about how the features of Rust were used to good effect in
the project.


Score: 10/10
